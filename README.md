# taxi-app
A project to help solve the difficulties in ordering taxis in Fredericton, NB.

## intital brainstorm
Goal: Easier taxi services in Fredericton

What does easier mean?
- Currently we have to call to get a taxi. Have it based on the web.
- Many options of services, we want a centralized source to access all the companies
- Either focus on one company (so we can take our product to them)
- Create for all companies (competition matters)

Decided: For now, letâ€™s focus on one company and make an app for them.

Future: Expand on a larger for all companies in Fredericton

Problem to solve: 
1. Visualization of map for location of taxi
2. Directly pinpoint rider and driver location instead of describing over the phone
3. Digitalization of company (having a digital footprint)
4. Booking by calling may be inconvenient for people (Old School)

Benefits:
1. Possible monetization for application
2. Can utilize app in different cities (provinces)
3. Can help customer retention (for returning customer)

Notes:
Use only number initially
OTP to confirm driver

Technologies being used:
- Database setup - MariaDB
- Frontend - HTML, CSS, React
- Backend - Python
- (For now focus on it working locally) - Server for host - AWS?
